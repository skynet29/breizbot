        is NetOS’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating.

    <h1>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h1>

    <p>
        Certain users to NetOS’s skill choose to interact with NetOS in ways that require NetOS to gather
        personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that NetOS gathers depends on the nature
        of the interaction. For example, we use the provided access token to fetch information stored in your NetOS account. NetOS collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the
        purpose of the users's interaction with NetOS. NetOS does not disclose personally-identifying information other
        than as described below. And users can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information by not
        disabling the skill.
    </p>

    <h1>Information We Collect from Other Sources</h1>

    <p>
        With your authorization, we also obtain information about you from other sources. When you link your account to
        NetOS, we will receive information from that service via an API call to that service.
    </p>

    <h1>Retention Policy</h1>

    <p>
        We will not retain any user provided data.

    <h1>Data</h1>


    To be able to investigate issues with the skill, NetOS stores logs on NetOS server included
    personally-identifying information as well, which are not exposed, sold or used besides the tracking of issues.

    <h1>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h1>

    <p>
        NetOS discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its
        employees, that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on NetOS’s behalf, and (ii) that have
        agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees may be located outside of your home country; by
        using NetOS’s skill, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. NetOS will not rent or sell
        potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its
        employees, as described above, NetOS discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
        information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when NetOS believes in
        good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of NetOS, third parties or
        the public at large. NetOS takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access,
        use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
